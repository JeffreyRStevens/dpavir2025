1. Using the `mtcars` data, create a scatterplot of the fuel efficiency as a function of weight.

```{r}
# >
```

2. Repeat the scatterplot, but make the points _violet_ open squares of size 5.

```{r}
# >
```

3. Repeat the scatterplot but with separate colors for cylinder levels.

```{r}
# >
```

4. Why does the legend look like that? Fix it so there are separate colors for cylinder levels.

```{r}
# >
```

5. Overlay separate regression lines for each cylinder level.

```{r}
# >
```

6. Overlay a single _firebrick_ regression line over the points with a _firebrick1_-colored confidence band.

```{r}
# >
```

7. Plot the mean and standard error of the mean of fuel efficiency for each level of cylinder and color them _sienna_.

```{r}
# >
```
