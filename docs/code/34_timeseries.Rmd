1. Using the `mpg` data, calculate the mean highway fuel efficiency for each number of cylinders and plot a line graph of fuel efficiency by cylinder number.

```{r}
# >
```


2. Repeat the previous plot but also group by class and plot separately colored lines for different classes.

```{r}
# >
```


3. Create a new column called `low_high` that codes high fuel efficiency greater than or equal to 25 as 1 and less than 25 as 0. Plot `low_high` as a function of displacement with a bubble chart (no legend) and include a logistic regression curve and band.

```{r}
# >
```


4. Plot highway fuel efficiency for each class as points first, then add jitter, finding an appropriate amount of jitter to add.

```{r}
# >
```


5. Repeat plot #4 with a beeswarm plot.

```{r}
# >
```
