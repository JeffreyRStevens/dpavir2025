1. Write a for loop that calculates the mean bill length for each species in the `penguins` data set (don't use `group_by()`) and saves them as `species_means`.

```{r}
# >
```

<!-- 2. Turn #1 into a function called `species_mean` that calculates the mean for one specific species that the user can specify. -->

<!-- ```{r}
# >
``` -->

2. Create a list `penguins_island` that separates the penguins data by island.

```{r}
# >
```

3. Apply `map()` to find the number of observations for each year.

```{r}
# >
```


4. Apply `map()` to calculate the mean body weight for each island.

```{r}
# >
```

5. Rework #5 to return a _numeric vector_ with values rounded to 1 decimal place.

```{r}
# >
```
