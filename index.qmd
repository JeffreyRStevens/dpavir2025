Welcome! This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts and methods used in the R statistical software package to process, visualize, and disseminate data. The course is based around [_R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) and [_Fundamentals of Data Visualization_](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/index.html) and assumes no prior coding experience.

## Instructor

[Jeffrey (Jeff) Stevens](https://jeffreyrstevens.quarto.pub) is a Professor in the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.unl.edu) and the [Center for Brain, Biology & Behavior](https://cb3.unl.edu) at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu). He is also a Data Science Mentor at [Posit](https://posit.co) (formerly RStudio), a company that develops open source data science tools such as RStudio IDE and tidyverse. Jeff has been using R since 2010 (and the predecessor S-PLUS since 1998) and integrating it into his documents and presentations since then. He has also developed three R packages available on CRAN: [`{excluder}`](https://docs.ropensci.org/excluder/) helps researchers exclude participant data collected from online surveys; [`{flashr}`](https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/flashr/) creates flashcards for learning terms and descriptions to help people learn and remember what R functions do; and [`{cocoon}`](https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/cocoon/) helps researchers extract, format, and print statistics in their R Markdown or Quarto documents.
