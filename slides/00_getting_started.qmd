## What is R?


R is a statistical programming language.

It allows you to  flexibly

* wrangle data

* visualize data

* analyze data

* create reproducible documents


---

## Conventions

* All `code` is in monospace font purple text

* R functions end with parentheses: `function()`

* Directory names end with slash: `home/`

* Package names are surrounded by curly braces: [`{tidyverse}`](https://tidyverse.org)

* Keyboard buttons separate keys with a plus: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>

* These are parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, and braces `{}`

* Links are in [light blue text]()

## Getting started

### Installing R
Download at [https://r-project.org](https://r-project.org).

For Windows, also install [Rtools](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/rtools.html)



---

## Getting started

### Installing RStudio

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Download from [Posit](https://posit.co/downloads/)


---

## Getting started

### Interacting with R

Using the R console

## Packages

Packages are collections of function and data sets

---

## Packages

Base R is a core set of packages for all R installations.

![Source: [A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse](https://moderndive.netlify.app/images/shutterstock/R_vs_R_packages.png)](../images/r_vs_r_packages.png)

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-note}
User-contributed packages can be found on the Comprehensive R Archive Network or [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/index.html).
:::
:::


::: {.notes}
Base R is the core, default software needed to run R maintained by the R Development Team. It includes a few core packages that underly much of R.

But other people can contribute packages, or collections of data and functions.

The official repository for R packages is the Comprehensive R Archive Network or [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/index.html). There are more than 19,000 packages on CRAN!

Packages can also be stored at other locations such as [GitHub](https://github.com) especially during development.

## Packages

### Installing

In the console type 

`install.packages("<package_name>")` where `<package_name>` is the name of the package.

---

## Packages

### Installing

Try installing the [`{palmerpenguins}`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) package.
``` {r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

::: {.fragment}
You can install multiple packages simultaneously by wrapping them with `c()`. For example, 
``` {r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages(c("remotes", "here"))
```

### Loading packages

![Source: [Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/00-getting-started.html)](../images/install_vs_load.jpg){height="400"}

---

## Packages

### Loading packages

Load the [`{here}`](https://here.r-lib.org) package:

``` {r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library("here")
```

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-note}
Every time you close your R session, you'll have to reload the packages you were using. 
:::
:::

:::{.notes}
Installing packages just means that you have copies of them on your computer. You have to load them for R to have access to their functionality. To load packages, use the `library()` function.

Now, all of the functions in the here package are available for us to use.
:::


---

## Packages

### Using

Let's view the `penguins` data set from the [`{palmerpenguins}`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) package.

Try this:
``` {r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
penguins
```

:::{.fragment}
You should receive `Error: object 'penguins' not found`. Why did you receive this error?
:::

:::{.notes}
Once you load a package, you have access to all of its functions for that R session. But if it is not loaded, you won't have access.

:::

---

## Packages

But you can either load the [`{palmerpenguins}`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) package, or use this trick to call a specific function from a specific package.
``` {r echo = TRUE}
palmerpenguins::penguins
```
