We'll move from cleaning columns to working with rows. We'll use the [{dplyr}](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) `filter()` functions to only keep rows that we want to keep.

## Learning objectives

* Filter rows based on data values
* Refine understanding of conditional statements
* Remove missing data
* Arrange rows based on data values
