We often work with categorical variables, and R coerces them into a special data type called a factor. Factors are augmented integers with levels and labels.

## Learning objectives

* Check levels of factors
* Reorder factor levels
* Recode factor labels

## Pre-meeting

* Reordering levels in order of frequency, presence in the vector, or reverse order
* Recoding factor labels
* Collapseing and lumping factor labels
* [Slides](../../slides/22_factors.qmd){target="_blank"} and [Code](../../code/22_factors.html){target="_blank"}
