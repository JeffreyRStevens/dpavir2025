Functions reduce repetition in code, but you may need to iterate to apply the function across multiple objects.

## Learning objectives

* Create for loops
* Apply functions repeatedly across data with map()
* Apply the same model across multiple data sets
* Apply the same plot across multiple data sets
* Import multiple data files simultaneously
