Often we have many steps of data processing to wrangle it appropriately. Rather than having to save every intermediate step, we can use pipes to create chains of steps.

## Learning objectives

* Learn when to use pipes
* Compare base R and tidyverse pipes
* Apply pipes to optimize coding

## Pre-meeting

To prepare for this class meeting, please do the following:

* Read [R4DS2 5](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-pipes.html){target='_blank'}

## Class meeting

* Base R vs. tidyverse pipes
* Piping basics
* Advanced piping
* [Slides](../../slides/12_piping.qmd){target="_blank"} and [Code](../../code/12_piping.html){target="_blank"}

## Homework after the class meeting
### Wrap up this lesson

* Complete the [exercises](https://jeffreyrstevens.shinyapps.io/dpavir2023_12_piping/){target='_blank'}

### For next class meeting
