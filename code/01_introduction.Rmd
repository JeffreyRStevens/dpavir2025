Let's go to R's console, which is the direct connection to the R engine. In the console, you give R a command, and it returns the output.

## Numerical operations

R can be a very fancy calculator. Let's do some calculations by entering numerical operations into the console. How many seconds are there in a year?
```{r}
# >
```

On average, how many days are in each month of a leap year?
```{r}
# >
```

## Text

R also can store, manipulate, and return text. But working with text requires wrapping the characters in quotation marks (either \" or \'). Type this out and replace `<name>` with your name: `"My name is <name>!"`.
```{r}
# >
```

You can also apply functions to text. If we want to yell our names, let's convert the string of characters to upper case with the `toupper()` function. Put the previous text inside the parentheses of `toupper()`.
```{r}
# >
```

Press the up arrow ⬆️ to place previous commands in the console. Navigate to the previous command and change the text a bit.

## Packages

If you haven't already, install the `{palmerpenguins}` and `{tidyverse}` packages. Remember how to do that?
```{r}
# >
```

Now that we have installed the `{palmerpenguins}` package, we want to look at the `penguins` data set from that package. What do we need to do first to get access to things in the package?
```{r}
# >
```


View the data set by typing `penguins` into the console.
```{r}
# >
```

## Plot data 

Excellent! Let's say we want to make a scatterplot of the bill length vs. the bill depth for all birds. We can use the `plot()` function for this by passing the y-variable name, a tilde `~`, the x-variable name, and then the name of the dataset. Something like `plot(y ~ x, data = dataset)`. Replace these variables with the ones for bill length and depth in the `penguins` dataset.

```{r}
# >
```

Hey, hey! We have a plot! 📊 Sweet! We've viewed and plotted data. Well done! 🎉 💪
