**Work in groups of 2-3**

* Install the [`{papaja}`](https://frederikaust.com/papaja_man/) package.

* Find the help page for the `apa_num()` function from `{papaja}`. What does it do?

* What is the keyboard shortcut for restarting R?

* What does the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd`+`Enter/Return` do?

* Type `cor()` in the console, and place your cursor in the word `cor`. Now press `F1`. What happened? Place your cursor back on `cor` and press `F2`. What happened?

* Change your theme for RStudio. If you're feeling adventurous, check out the custom themes at <https://github.com/mkearney/rstudiothemes> and install one of them.
