* Think about where would make the most sense to have a project directory for this course. Do you want it in your OneDrive directory? Do you want it in a specific directory?

* Create the class directory using good naming conventions.

* Create subdirectories that you might need for the class (e.g., assignments, code, data, notes, etc.).

* Create an R Project inside that directory.

* Open the R Project in RStudio. What is the working directory?

* In the terminal, view all of the subdirectories in your project directory.

* Change to `data/` directory. Now change back to the project's home directory. Can you go up to the parent directory?

* Create a directory and R Project for a project that you are working on that will require using R. Build the subdirectories that you'll need, including `data/`, `docs/`, and `R/`.
