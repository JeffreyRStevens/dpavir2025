1. Using the `penguins` data, create a boxplot that shows penguin flipper length by island without outliers.

```{r}
# >
```

2. Add the means and standard error for each boxplot.

```{r}
# >
```

3. Switch from standard errors to confidence intervals, increase the size of the point, and color the box shading _chocolate_.

```{r}
# >
```

4. Fill the boxplots with color separately for each island and remove the legend.

```{r}
# >
```


5. Create a boxplot to show how flipper length differs for each species by island.

```{r}
# >
```


6. Recreate the boxplot #5 as a violin plot with a white background.

```{r}
# >
```
