1. Using the `mtcars` data, create a scatterplot of the fuel efficiency as a function of weight with color based on the number of cylinders.

```{r}
# >
```

2. Repeat the scatterplot but with classic, bw, and dark themes.

```{r}
# >
```

3. Repeat the scatterplot from #1 but with no minor grid lines and no legend.

```{r}
# >
```

4. Repeat the scatterplot from #1 but no minor grid lines for the x-axis (keep them for the y-axis) and move the legend inside the plot area and remove the legend title.

```{r}
# >
```

5. Repeat the scatterplot from #1 but make the major y-axis grid lines black dashed lines and change the text font to 12 point Times font.

```{r}
# >
```

6. Create a version of scatterplot #1 that minimizes the data-ink ratio by reducing non-data-ink.

```{r}
# >
```
