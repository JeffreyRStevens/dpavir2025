1. Using the `mtcars` data, create a scatterplot of the fuel efficiency as a function of weight.

```{r}
# >
```

2. Repeat the plot but only with vehicles having 4 or 6 cylinders.

```{r}
# >
```

3. Repeat plot #1 but add a smooth line **underneath** the data points.

```{r}
# >
```

4. Make a boxplot of fuel efficiency for each cylinder size.

```{r}
# >
```

5. Add " cylinders" to the end of each value in the cylinder column of data and replot #4.

```{r}
# >
```

6. Replot #4 ordering the cylinders such that the median mpg increases from left to right.

```{r}
# >
```
