Load tidyverse, download and import [`dog_breed_traits_clean.csv`](https://jeffreyrstevens.quarto.pub/dpavir/data/dog_breed_traits_clean.csv) to `traits`, and import [`dog_breed_ranks.csv`](https://jeffreyrstevens.quarto.pub/dpavir/data/dog_breed_ranks.csv) to `ranks`. **Make sure to download both files from the website, as they have changed or are new.**\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n2.
