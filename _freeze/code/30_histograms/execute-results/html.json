Using the `mtcars` data, create a histogram of the fuel efficiency values.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n2. Not a great histogram. Mess with the number of bins until you get a nice histogram.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n3. Now change the bin width to generate the same plot as #2.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n4. Using the same binwidth from #3, plot a histogram with _lightseagreen_ lines and _aquamarine3_ shaded areas. Then overlay a density plot with a _aquamarine4_ line with width 2.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n5. What is the difference between a frequency polygon and a density plot?\n\n\n6. Make a density plot with bandwidth of 3 and separate line colors for different cylinder levels.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Repeat #6 but also include separate colors for the shaded areas with a transparency of 0.5. Use viridis colors for both lines and shaded areas, and reverse the direction of the colors where 4 is yellow, 6 is greenish, and 8 is purplish.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n",
