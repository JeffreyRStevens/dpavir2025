Load tidyverse, import [`dates.csv`](https://jeffreyrstevens.quarto.pub/dpavir/data/dates.csv) to `dates`, and view the data set.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Convert `birth_date` to a date object and resave `dates`.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Create a column called _time1_ that converts _test1_ to datetime and change the time zone to \"America/Chicago\".\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Calculate each participant's age in years at the time of test 1, rounded to 1 decimal place, stored in _age_ and resave `dates`.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Calculate the number of days between test 1 and test 2 for each participant and label this column _test_diff_ (and resave `dates`).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Create `dates2` that subsets the participants who were born after January 1, 1970.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Create a column named _diff_text_ that writes the following sentence for each participant in `dates2`: \"Participant [insert _id_] (age: [insert _age_]) had test 1 on [insert _test1_] and test 2 on [insert _test2_], which were [insert _test_diff_] days apart.\"\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n",
