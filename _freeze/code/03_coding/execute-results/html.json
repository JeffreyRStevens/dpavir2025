In the console, you give R a command, and it returns the output.\n\n## Assignment\n\nRemember our text string with our names?\n```\n\"My name is Jeff!\"\n```\n\nIt is repetitive to have to copy/paste text. We can _assign_ things to _objects_, which store the contents in a variable. The assignment operator `<-` assigns the value of the right hand side to the object on the left hand side. Use the `<-` operator to assign the name text to an object called `my_name`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow print the contents of `my_name` by just typing it into the console.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow apply the `toupper()` function to `my_name` rather than the actual character string.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nHow do we find out all of the arguments for the `toupper()` function?\n\nLet's specify the argument names not just the value.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# >\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nPress the up arrow to navigate to the assignment command and change the object name to something different.\n\n## Names\n\nWhy did I assign the text to the object `my_name` and not, for example, `names`?\n\nWhat all is wrong with the file name `Qualtrics experiment 3 ~ 01/05/22 [final_FINAL].xlsx`?\n\nWhat would be a better name for this file?\n\nWhy is this date problematic? 01/05/25\n\nWhat would be an ISO 8601 format for this date?\n\nWhy is it useful to include dates in files names?\n\n",
