## Directories

### Paths

Here is an absolute path to some data:

`/home/jeff/projects/dog_telepathy/data/raw_data/`

```{r directories}
quiz(
  question("If you are in the `dog_telepathy/` directory, how would you use the command line to get to `raw_data/` using a _relative path_?",
           answer("`cd data/raw_data/`", correct = TRUE),
           answer("`cd /home/jeff/projects/dog_telepathy/data/raw_data/`", message = "This would get you there, but it does not use a relative path."),
           answer("`cd /data/raw_data/`", message = "Starting with `/` creates an absolute path."),
           answer("`cd ../data/raw_data`", message = "Using `..` goes backwards in the path."),
           answer("`cd ../../data/raw_data`", message = "Using `..` goes backwards in the path."),
           allow_retry = TRUE,
           random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question("If you are in the `dog_telepathy/` directory, select TWO ways to use the command line to get to `jeff/`?",
           answer("`cd /home/jeff/`", correct = TRUE),
           answer("`cd ../../`", correct = TRUE),
           answer("`cd ../../..`", message = "You went too far."),
           answer("`cd ../`", message = "Not far enough."),
           answer("`cd home/jeff/`", message = "Without an initial `/`, this is looking for a relative path from this directory."),
           allow_retry = TRUE,
           random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```

### Directory structure

The next question is based on this directory structure.

![](images/directory.png)

```{r working-directory}
question("When you open the R Project shown above (`dog_telepathy.Rproj`), what will be the _working directory_ for that project?",
         answer("`jeff/projects/dog_telepathy/`", correct = TRUE),
         answer("`jeff/projects/`", message = "The `.Rproj` file is not in that directory."),
         answer("`jeff/projects/dog_telepathy/.Rproj.user/`", message = "The `.Rproj` file is not in that directory."),
         answer("`jeff/projects/dog_telepathy/dog_telepathy.Rproj`", message = "This is a file rather than a directory."),
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```


### Wrap-up

Congratulations, you finished the tutorial!

To get credit for this assignment, replace my name with the first name that you submitted in the course introduction form in the code below and click *Run Code* to generate the text for you to submit to Canvas. 

```{r exit_function}
letter_nums <- letters[1:26]
generate_text <- function(x) {
  x <- tolower(x)
  offset <- 20
  if (!is.character(x)) stop("Oops! Did you surround your name with quotation marks?")
  if (x == "jeff") stop("Oops! You left my name in. Please type your name.")
  x <- stringr::str_sub(x, 1, 4)
  expanded <- stringr::str_split_fixed(x, "", 4)
  name_nums <- match(expanded, letter_nums)
  name_nums <- name_nums[!is.na(name_nums)]
  new_nums <- as.character(name_nums + offset)
  new_text <- paste("Now copy this string of numbers and submit them to Canvas:", stringr::str_c(new_nums, collapse = ""))
  return(new_text)
}
```

```{r exit_code, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "exit_function"}
# replace my name below with your first name (surrounded by quotes)
first_name <- "Jeff"
generate_text(first_name)
```

### Assignment complete

Copy that code into Canvas, and you're all set for this tutorial.
